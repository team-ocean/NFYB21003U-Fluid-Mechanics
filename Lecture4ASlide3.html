            <p>In principle, these equations can be solved for the velocity field \(\mathbf{u}\) and pressure field \( p \), given sufficient initial and boundary conditions. Note that in general, \( u, v, w, \) and \( p \) all depend on \( x, y, z, \) and \( t \). 
            In practice, there is no general analytic solution to these equations, for the combined effect of a number of reasons (none of which is insurmountable by itself): </p>
            <ul class="custom-list">
                <li>They are coupled. The unknowns, \( u, v, w, \) and \( p \), appear in all the equations (\( p \) is not in the continuity equation) and we cannot manipulate the equations to end up with a single equation for any one of the unknowns. Hence we must solve for all unknowns simultaneously.</li>
                <li>They are nonlinear. For example, the convective acceleration term \( u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + w \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}\)
                    has products of \( u \) with itself as well as with \( v \) and \( w \). The consequence of this is that we cannot take one solution to the equations and combine it with a second solution to obtain a third solution. If frictionless flow is assumed, linear equations can be derived to do this combining procedure.</li>
                <li>They are second-order partial differential equations. For example, the viscous term
                    \(
                    \mu \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} \right)
                    \)
                    is second-order in \( u \). These are obviously of a different order of complexity.</li>
