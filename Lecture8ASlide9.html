                                <p>To any one-dimensional system \(\dot{x} = f(x)\), just need to draw the graph of \(f(x)\) and then use it to sketch the vector field on the real line</p>

        <p>Imagine that a fluid is flowing along the real line with a local velocity \(f(x)\). This imaginary fluid is called the phase fluid, and the real line is the phase space. The flow is to the right where \(f(x) > 0\) and to the left where \(f(x) < 0\). To find the solution to \(\dot{x} = f(x)\) starting from an arbitrary initial condition \(x_0\), 
            place an imaginary particle (a <span class="sql">phase point</span>) at \(x_0\) and watch how it is carried along by the flow. As time goes on, the phase point moves along the \(x\)-axis according to some function \(x(t)\). </p>
            <p>This function is called the <span class="sql">trajectory</span> based at \(x_0\), and it represents the solution of the differential equation starting from the initial condition \(x_0\). A figure shows all the qualitatively different trajectories of the system is called a <span class="sql">phase portrait</span></p>

        <div class="description">
            <p>The appearance of the phase portrait is controlled by the fixed points \(x^*\), defined by \(f(x^*) = 0\); they correspond to stagnation points of the flow. \(\boxed{\text{ fixed points} = 
                \begin{cases}
                \text{stable (attractor, sink)} \\
                \text{unstable (repeller, source)}
                \end{cases}}
                \) </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The solid black dot is a stable fixed point (the local flow is toward it)</li>
                    <li>The open dot is an unstable fixed point (the flow is away from it)</li>
