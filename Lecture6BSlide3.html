            <p>For situations where the viscous terms in the Navier-Stokes equations were dropped because the flow was ideal (irrotational and of constant density) or the effects of viscosity were small, the underlying assumptions were either that</p>
            <ul>
                <li>viscous forces and rotational flow were spatially confined to a small portion of the flow domain (thin boundary layers near solid surfaces)</li>
                <li>fluid particle accelerations caused by fluid inertia ~\(U²/L\) were much larger than those caused by viscosity ~\(μU/ρL²\), where \(U\) is a characteristic velocity, \(L\) is a characteristic length, \(ρ\) is the fluid’s density, and \(μ\) is the fluid’s viscosity</li>

            <p>However, for low values of the Reynolds number, the <span class="sql">entire flow</span> may be influenced by viscosity, and inviscid flow theory is no longer even approximately correct</p>
