                <p>The position of a smooth ball resting on the inside surface of a hemispherical bowl is stable provided the bowl is concave upwards. However, the ball's position is unstable to small displacements if placed on the outer side of a hemispherical bowl when the bowl is concave downwards</p>

                <p>In fluid flows, smooth laminar flows are stable to small disturbances only when certain conditions are satisfied. For example, in the flow of a homogeneous viscous fluid in a channel, the Reynolds number must be less than some critical value for the flow to be stable, and in a stratified shear flow, the Richardson number must be larger than a critical value for stability</p>
            </div>

            <div class="description">
                <p>When these conditions are not satisfied, infinitesimal disturbances may grow spontaneously and completely change the character of the original flow. Sometimes the disturbances can grow to finite amplitude and reach a new steady-state equilibrium. The new state may then become unstable to other types of disturbances, and may evolve to yet another steady state, and so on</p>
