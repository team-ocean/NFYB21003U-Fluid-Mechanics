                <p><i>A two-dimensional, or plane</i>, flow is one in which the variation of flow characteristics can be described by two spatial coordinates. The flow of an ideal fluid past a circular cylinder of infinite length having its axis perpendicular to the primary flow direction is an example of a plane flow. This definition of two-dimensional flow officially includes the flow around bodies of revolution where flow characteristics are identical in any plane that contains the bodyâ€™s axis. However, such flows are customarily called <i>three-dimensional axisymmetric flows</i>.</p>

                <p><i>A three-dimensional</i> flow is one that can only be properly described with three independent spatial coordinates and is the most general case considered in this text. Sometimes curvilinear coordinates that match flow-field boundaries or symmetries greatly simplify the analysis and description of flow fields.</p>

                <p>Several different coordinate systems are used. Two-dimensional (plane) Cartesian and polar coordinates for an arbitrary point P may be denoted by the coordinate pairs \((x,y)\), \((x_1,x_2)\), or \((r, \theta)\) with the corresponding velocity components \((u, v)\), \((u_1, u_2)\), or \((u_r, u_\theta)\).</p>

                <p>In three dimensions, Cartesian coordinates may be used to locate a point P via the coordinate triplets \((x,y,z)\) or \((x_1,x_2,x_3)\) with corresponding velocity components \((u, v, w)\) or \((u_1, u_2, u_3)\).</p>
