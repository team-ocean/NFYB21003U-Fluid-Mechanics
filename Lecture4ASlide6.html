                <p>CFD is now used for essentially all engineering designs, greatly reducing (although not eliminating!) the need for expensive prototyping and testing. Both Boeing and Airbus use CFD for the design of new airplanes and all automakers do the same. The makers of internal combustion engines and turbomachinery rely on CFD, as do designers of buildings and bridges. 
                    CFD is used to predict aerodynamic performance, structural loads, and noise, the performance of consumer goods and power plants, and increasingly the dynamics of living things. In short, CFD is used everywhere. 
                    While CFD has now become a well-established part of the scientific and engineering “toolbox,” in the new century the availability of computers of unprecedented power is redefining the field</p>

                <p>Not only are we rapidly learning to model systems of enormous complexity, we now expect the results to be reliable and accurate and include an assessment of the uncertainty as well as the sensitivity to the various input parameters</p>
