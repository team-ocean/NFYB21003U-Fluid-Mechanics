                <p>The classical hydrodynamical theory assumes that perfect slipping takes
                    place, whereas in actual fluids the surface layers of the fluid are churned up
                    into eddies. In the case of motions which depend on the conditions at the
                    surface, therefore, no agreement is to be expected between theory and experi
                    ment. This class of fluid motion, unfortunately, includes all cases where a
                    solid moves through a fluid which is otherwise at rest</p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, there are types of fluid motion which only depend to a
                    secondary extent on the slip at the boundaries. For this reason theoretical
                    predictions about waves and tides, or about the motion of vortex rings, are in
                    much better agreement with observation than predictions about the motion of
                    solids in fluids</p>
